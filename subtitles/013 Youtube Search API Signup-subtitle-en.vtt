WEBVTT

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.220
And the last section we put together a plan for the different components that we're going to use inside

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.610
of our application and created one file for each of them.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.410
Remember deciding how to break up your application into several components is a little bit arbitrary

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.650
figuring out the best way to do it is something that really just comes with practice.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.790
In this section we're going to talk about exactly what videos we're going to play here.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.560
Well as I mentioned before they're going to be actual youtube videos.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.210
We're going to use the YouTube API to fetch data and show real YouTube videos to our users using the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.440
YouTube API is really a two step process.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.290
First we need to sign up for a youtube API Ickey getting access to API is 100 percent free.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.490
But you do need a key for it.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.470
YouTube is happy to let you search and play their videos but they really want to know who is searching

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.550
through their videos as such we just need an API key to identify ourselves.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.910
Whenever we try to access their API after we sign up for the key install a small package that will make

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.910
searching the searching process very simple.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.800
So lets go ahead and get to it in my browser.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.750
I'm going to navigate to Townsell dot developers dot Google dot com

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.170
if you don't have a Google account you're going to need to sign up for one to get access to the dashboard

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.610
.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.950
Google accounts are free.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.360
So just sign up for one really quick and come back to this dashboard.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.520
Now as great as Google is you know so many free services it's fantastic.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200
Some of their interfaces are really tough to get around.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.910
So bear with me here.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.750
Once you're at the dashboard click on the icon on the top left the hamburger menu appear in the lines

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.710
and then click on API manager.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.240
So this'll take us to another menu

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.050
which is the API manager for our for your account.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.650
So as you can see there's many different API that you can find here.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.030
We're going to search for a very specific one where you can put in YouTube.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.080
Now you'll find YouTube data API v3.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.990
Make sure that you're using specifically this API right here.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.420
So just go ahead and click it and this page right here just tells you.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.120
Well you know once you sign off the API hears all the different things you can do blah blah blah whatever

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.940
.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.260
At the top you'll find a button right here that says enable API.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.410
I've already enabled mine so right now right now this is disable but for you it'll probably say enable

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.970
API go ahead and just click it it'll do some work and then it'll say you know disable API and I'll tell

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.770
you that you successfully enable the API.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.150
So now that we have the API enabled we need to get an actual API key.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.640
So on the left hand side you'll find the credentials button.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.870
I'm going to go ahead and click it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:16.170
and then I'll click new credentials API key and then out of the four choices here we specifically want

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.790
to get access to a browser key.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.170
So I'm going to click browser key you know Lassman name it.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.110
And I'm just going to say you know browser key two is fine.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.990
We don't need to put in a referrer right here.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.790
So totally optional.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.950
So Lasi me to do is just click Create.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.320
So now we get this pop up right here that has API key that we need to go ahead and select it and copy

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.420
it.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.840
Now we're going to flip back over to our code editor and save the key right away.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.080
So at the very top I'm going to make a new line and we're going to declare a variable to hold this API

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.550
key.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.270
Now remember when we're using E6 we don't use the VAR keyword to declare variables anymore.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.260
We can use Konst or we can also use lead and we'll talk about it in a little bit.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.310
We use Const whenever we make a variable that doesn't change.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.800
So as you might imagine this API key isn't ever going to change so we'll declare it as a concept and

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:27.090
since it is a constant a true constant we'll write API underscore key so that anyone look at our code

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.210
in the future knows that this is a constant.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.680
And then we'll put in a string.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.020
So you know quote double quote whichever one you prefer and then we'll just paste the key in.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.490
Cool.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.450
So we now have our API key which is going to allow us to make requests to YouTube.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.890
So the next step is to download and install a package that is going to help us make these search requests

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.530
to do so.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.870
We're going to install an NPM package called YouTube API search this place.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.220
This package has basically one purpose giving an API key in a search term.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.920
It will go to make an API request for us in return some data you know a list of videos that match the

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.420
search term like other packages that are already installed in this project.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.950
You know all the ones we see here in the modules folder we're going to install this using NPM or the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.500
node package manager.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:31.230
So over in my terminal I can make sure that I'm inside of my project directory and I'm going to install

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.140
this as a new package.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:44.100
So all right NPM install dash dash save then YouTube dash API dash search.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.980
Let's make sure we get that all in one line.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.130
There we go.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.390
OK.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.980
So this is going to reach out to the NPM registry and install this package for us when we use the dash

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.520
dash.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.460
Save right here.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.670
That means please save this to our package.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.860
Some file and of the project.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.430
The package just on file is a list of all the dependencies that our project has.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.180
So I just opened the package.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.350
It's on file right here and you'll see that we've already got a number of dependencies in here.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.770
You know these are the packages that were installed with this boilerplate application that allows it

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.630
to you know make use of stuff like web pack in Babel.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.180
You can also see react and react on them in here.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.490
And you can also see the one that we just installed.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.010
YouTube API search.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.750
OK.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.550
So looks good.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.010
We got a package installed.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.680
Let's continue in the next section
