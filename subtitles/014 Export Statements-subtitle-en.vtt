00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.550
In the last section we signed up for the YouTube API and this section we're going to go off on a little

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.710
bit of a tangent before we start making use of that API.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.200
So instead of working with any of the data from YouTube just yet we're going to start working on the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.690
search bar first in setting up the search for search bar.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.380
We're going to cover three very important topics ex-party modules classes and state once we've discussed

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.730
these three concepts We'll come back to working with the data from the YouTube API.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.280
So let's work on the search bar for a bit by opening search bar.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.250
Jay Yes.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.860
So is the purpose of this component again is just to make sure that we have an input at the top that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.100
the user can type in and they type into the input.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.530
It should update the video list on the right hand side.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.530
So basically user types input we need to make an API request to the YouTube API.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.550
So you haven't done anything in here just yet but we do know that we need a text input and when a user

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.430
types something in.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.520
We need to do a search of some sort.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.370
So let's define our component first in the same way that we define the one inside of index Dot.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:19.860
Yes we'll say Konst search bar and we will define a function and return just an input.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.100
We don't need to close the input because you know with like a closing input because we're not going

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.190
to put anything inside this component so this will generate in its T.M. input that the user can type

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.560
text into.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.110
One other thing even though we're not making reference to a variable called you know react in here we

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.980
still need to include it so writes in poor re-act from react at the top.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.270
We need to do this because remember whenever we can whenever we translate the GSX to normal javascript

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.500
it turns into a call like Riak dog create element.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.160
And so if re-act isn't in the scope of this file Well it's going to throw in there.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.450
So we just need to make sure that we import react into all of our components that we write that have

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.850
GSX.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.880
OK.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.690
So this is just going to show a no frills input.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.300
Now we need something to make sure that the user can see it or we know we need to do something to make

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.570
sure the user can see it right now.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.390
All we've done right now is define V define that component.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.890
It's not being rendered to the DOM it's not being rendered inside of index.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.980
Yes.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.120
So do you remember that re-act components can show other components.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.880
So if we get the search bar component over into index yes we can use indexed not just to show the input

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.500
.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.920
Just one problem to render the search bar index needs a reference to this.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.480
And remember as we mentioned previously all of our files are siloed from each other unless we explicitly

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.510
declare a connection between the two of them.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.990
So we already learned how to import files that we haven't yet discussed how to export code.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.840
Right we haven't.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.850
We haven't learned what's happening on the other side of this re-act of this you know import state and

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.950
right here.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.360
So think about it for a second.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.330
A given file might have a ton of different coding that but we only want to export a small amount or

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.870
a subset of the code that we've written in here.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.700
So to make sure that the only code that we export from this file is this component right here we're

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.770
right at the bottom.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:39.060
Export default search bar now any file in our application that imports search bar will get our search

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.310
bar component.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.700
It's kind of confusing words.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.140
So let's you know go through it in practice and see what actually it looks like.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.070
I'm going to save this file and then we'll flip back over to it.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.840
When does it start.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.790
Yes.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:04:00.960
And at the top we'll write in your search bar from search your score bar.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:10.800
So now when search bar is required or steamy imported into this file search bar will be equal to search

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.970
bar right here which is the component.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.770
OK.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.190
So the distinction I want to draw here is if we had some other variable inside of here let's say like

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.400
Konst foo equals five.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.850
If we instead wrote export default foo search bar over here would be equal to 5.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.150
Not the component.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.960
So it's very critical to make sure that we correctly export.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.630
You know the component outside of each file so I can delete this and replace it with search bar like

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.460
so.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.260
OK.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.510
One more thing.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.850
Sure would be great if we could just write you know import search bar from search on her score bar and

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.140
then next xpect babble to correctly determine that OK they won't search far.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.470
They must mean you know a search bar.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.520
JS inside of the components folder.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.350
Well you know unfortunately it's not quite the case.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.300
Whenever we import code from a file that we write as a developer you know in actual javascript file

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.140
inside of here we have to give an actual file a reference to the file that we're trying to import.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.030
We don't have to do that with libraries that we import because their namespace right we really have

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:28.740
one installed package called re-act that literally means go you know import re-act from re-act literally

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.570
means go into the node modules folder and get the directory called re-act same thing with re-act job

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.800
.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.480
Juxtapose that with the search bar file.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:46.800
I could have 10 files inside of my project right here called Search underscore Barcott Jay Yes and babbel

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.470
would just have no idea which of those you know different files.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.800
I was asking for.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.740
So whenever we are working with our own files whenever we're importing our own files we have to give

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.700
an actual file reference.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.940
So what that means is we write the actual relative path from the file that we're importing it from.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.970
So we're importing search bar into index dot Yes.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.500
So all right here is in the current directory represented by a dot and then for a slash go into the

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:27.590
components folder come home and go and then find the file called Search under square bar.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.130
We don't need to include the file extension on here so long as it is a dot JS file.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.970
So again if it's a file that we write that we create ourselves we have to provide a file reference or

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.010
folder reference a path reference to it.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.930
But if it's a library that we installed with no with NPM we can just write the name of the package.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.640
OK.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:55.630
So we've now successfully imported our search bar into index dot J us and now we want to show it inside

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.810
of app.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.260
Give me the first time that we show another one component side of another.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.050
Fortunately as you might imagine it's really straightforward.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.920
I'm going to delete the high statement here and then I'm going to enter a new line.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:20.790
So we'll add our search bar inside of this existing div by just writing search bar like so for a multi

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.680
line GSX expression like this.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:30.600
Usually we'll use parentheses and put all the GSX inside of it like so.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.090
So you can kind of imagine you know that looks this looks something like Hey return this big old glob

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.160
of GSX right here wrapped in the parentheses.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.440
If you want to use the print you definitely don't have to just make sure that this div right here ends

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.880
up on the first line right here.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.260
Otherwise I'll get in there.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.390
OK.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:54.160
So we've now declared a new component called search bar that contains just an input.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:02.760
We exported that component from this file we imported it into index dot J Yes and then we rendered it

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:11.310
inside of our app component our app component is being rendered into the div inside of our index to

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.740
its single file with class container.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.310
So you can kind of imagine you know this is starting to form a tree of sorts and tree of components

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:18.670
.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:26.970
The very top level we have our app and then the first child inside of there is search bar are going

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:33.950
to go and save this and then flip back over to my browser let's refresh and it looks like we've got

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.190
an input here.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:36.700
Cool.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.730
This looks good.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.020
Let's go ahead and continue inside the next section
