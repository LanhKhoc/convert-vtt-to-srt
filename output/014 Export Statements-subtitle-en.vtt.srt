1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,550
In the last section we signed up for the YouTube API and this section we're going to go off on a little

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,710
bit of a tangent before we start making use of that API.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,200
So instead of working with any of the data from YouTube just yet we're going to start working on the

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,690
search bar first in setting up the search for search bar.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:25,380
We're going to cover three very important topics ex-party modules classes and state once we've discussed

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,730
these three concepts We'll come back to working with the data from the YouTube API.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,280
So let's work on the search bar for a bit by opening search bar.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,250
Jay Yes.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,860
So is the purpose of this component again is just to make sure that we have an input at the top that

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,100
the user can type in and they type into the input.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,530
It should update the video list on the right hand side.

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,530
So basically user types input we need to make an API request to the YouTube API.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,550
So you haven't done anything in here just yet but we do know that we need a text input and when a user

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,430
types something in.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,520
We need to do a search of some sort.

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,370
So let's define our component first in the same way that we define the one inside of index Dot.

17
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:19,860
Yes we'll say Konst search bar and we will define a function and return just an input.

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,100
We don't need to close the input because you know with like a closing input because we're not going

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,190
to put anything inside this component so this will generate in its T.M. input that the user can type

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,560
text into.

21
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,110
One other thing even though we're not making reference to a variable called you know react in here we

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,980
still need to include it so writes in poor re-act from react at the top.

23
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:54,270
We need to do this because remember whenever we can whenever we translate the GSX to normal javascript

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,500
it turns into a call like Riak dog create element.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,160
And so if re-act isn't in the scope of this file Well it's going to throw in there.

26
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,450
So we just need to make sure that we import react into all of our components that we write that have

27
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,850
GSX.

28
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:10,880
OK.

29
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,690
So this is just going to show a no frills input.

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,300
Now we need something to make sure that the user can see it or we know we need to do something to make

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,570
sure the user can see it right now.

32
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,390
All we've done right now is define V define that component.

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,890
It's not being rendered to the DOM it's not being rendered inside of index.

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,980
Yes.

35
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,120
So do you remember that re-act components can show other components.

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,880
So if we get the search bar component over into index yes we can use indexed not just to show the input

37
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,500
.

38
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,920
Just one problem to render the search bar index needs a reference to this.

39
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,480
And remember as we mentioned previously all of our files are siloed from each other unless we explicitly

40
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,510
declare a connection between the two of them.

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,990
So we already learned how to import files that we haven't yet discussed how to export code.

42
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,840
Right we haven't.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,850
We haven't learned what's happening on the other side of this re-act of this you know import state and

44
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,950
right here.

45
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,360
So think about it for a second.

46
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,330
A given file might have a ton of different coding that but we only want to export a small amount or

47
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,870
a subset of the code that we've written in here.

48
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,700
So to make sure that the only code that we export from this file is this component right here we're

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,770
right at the bottom.

50
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:39,060
Export default search bar now any file in our application that imports search bar will get our search

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,310
bar component.

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,700
It's kind of confusing words.

53
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,140
So let's you know go through it in practice and see what actually it looks like.

54
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,070
I'm going to save this file and then we'll flip back over to it.

55
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,840
When does it start.

56
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,790
Yes.

57
00:03:51,210 --> 00:04:00,960
And at the top we'll write in your search bar from search your score bar.

58
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:10,800
So now when search bar is required or steamy imported into this file search bar will be equal to search

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,970
bar right here which is the component.

60
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,770
OK.

61
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:20,190
So the distinction I want to draw here is if we had some other variable inside of here let's say like

62
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,400
Konst foo equals five.

63
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,850
If we instead wrote export default foo search bar over here would be equal to 5.

64
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,150
Not the component.

65
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,960
So it's very critical to make sure that we correctly export.

66
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:42,630
You know the component outside of each file so I can delete this and replace it with search bar like

67
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,460
so.

68
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,260
OK.

69
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,510
One more thing.

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,850
Sure would be great if we could just write you know import search bar from search on her score bar and

71
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,140
then next xpect babble to correctly determine that OK they won't search far.

72
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,470
They must mean you know a search bar.

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,520
JS inside of the components folder.

74
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,350
Well you know unfortunately it's not quite the case.

75
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,300
Whenever we import code from a file that we write as a developer you know in actual javascript file

76
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,140
inside of here we have to give an actual file a reference to the file that we're trying to import.

77
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,030
We don't have to do that with libraries that we import because their namespace right we really have

78
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:28,740
one installed package called re-act that literally means go you know import re-act from re-act literally

79
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,570
means go into the node modules folder and get the directory called re-act same thing with re-act job

80
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
.

81
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,480
Juxtapose that with the search bar file.

82
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:46,800
I could have 10 files inside of my project right here called Search underscore Barcott Jay Yes and babbel

83
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,470
would just have no idea which of those you know different files.

84
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,800
I was asking for.

85
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,740
So whenever we are working with our own files whenever we're importing our own files we have to give

86
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,700
an actual file reference.

87
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:04,940
So what that means is we write the actual relative path from the file that we're importing it from.

88
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,970
So we're importing search bar into index dot Yes.

89
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:16,500
So all right here is in the current directory represented by a dot and then for a slash go into the

90
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:27,590
components folder come home and go and then find the file called Search under square bar.

91
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,130
We don't need to include the file extension on here so long as it is a dot JS file.

92
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,970
So again if it's a file that we write that we create ourselves we have to provide a file reference or

93
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,010
folder reference a path reference to it.

94
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,930
But if it's a library that we installed with no with NPM we can just write the name of the package.

95
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,640
OK.

96
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,630
So we've now successfully imported our search bar into index dot J us and now we want to show it inside

97
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,810
of app.

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,260
Give me the first time that we show another one component side of another.

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,050
Fortunately as you might imagine it's really straightforward.

100
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm going to delete the high statement here and then I'm going to enter a new line.

101
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:20,790
So we'll add our search bar inside of this existing div by just writing search bar like so for a multi

102
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,680
line GSX expression like this.

103
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:30,600
Usually we'll use parentheses and put all the GSX inside of it like so.

104
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,090
So you can kind of imagine you know that looks this looks something like Hey return this big old glob

105
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,160
of GSX right here wrapped in the parentheses.

106
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,440
If you want to use the print you definitely don't have to just make sure that this div right here ends

107
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,880
up on the first line right here.

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,260
Otherwise I'll get in there.

109
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,390
OK.

110
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:54,160
So we've now declared a new component called search bar that contains just an input.

111
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:02,760
We exported that component from this file we imported it into index dot J Yes and then we rendered it

112
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:11,310
inside of our app component our app component is being rendered into the div inside of our index to

113
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,740
its single file with class container.

114
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,310
So you can kind of imagine you know this is starting to form a tree of sorts and tree of components

115
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,670
.

116
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:26,970
The very top level we have our app and then the first child inside of there is search bar are going

117
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:33,950
to go and save this and then flip back over to my browser let's refresh and it looks like we've got

118
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,190
an input here.

119
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:36,700
Cool.

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,730
This looks good.

121
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,020
Let's go ahead and continue inside the next section
